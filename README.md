# Exploratory_Vectorized_Backtest_And_Finding_Whales
In this repo, I am developing a way to find trading strategies quickly using a vectorized approach, I use this space to brainstorm and try to use my creativity to find strategies that could work, I do parameter sweeps to see how robust the strategy could be. I downloaded a lot of data that spots big purchases from binance in the file aggTrades.py , in this file I downloaded all the historical trades since 2020-07-01 (A LOT OF DATA THAT IS NOT IN THIS REPO, I AGGREGATED THIS DATA HOURLY AND STORED IT IN THE FILE aggTrades_aggregated_1h.csv), I added all trades and calulated the buy volume and sell volume to spot possible supply-demand imbalances. In the orderbook.py file I created a script to download the orderbook depth every minute (BIDS AND ASKS AND LIQUIDITY IN EACH PRICE LEVEL.. THIS DATA HAS TO BE COLLECTED 24/7 THATS MEANS IT WOULD HAVE TO RUN IN A SERVER AND COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT DATA TO CREATE A ROBUST TRADING STRATEGY). In the file FINDING_WHALES.py I try to spot those transactions that in quantity (BTC) are greater than 100 BTC , which could indicate a whale is buying and could be the start of a string move in one direction and I save those historical signals in a file called SIGNALS_THRESHOLD_100.csv.
